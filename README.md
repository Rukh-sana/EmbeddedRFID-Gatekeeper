# EmbeddedRFID-Gatekeeper 🔐
**Secure RFID Access Control System using STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) and MFRC522**

**EmbeddedRFID-Gatekeeper** is a robust and efficient embedded access control system built around the **STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill)** microcontroller and the **MFRC522 RFID reader**. Designed for secure identity verification, this system enables real-time RFID tag authentication and activates physical access mechanisms such as LEDs, buzzers, or relays through GPIO control.Leveraging **SPI communication** and the **STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**, the firmware ensures seamless integration between hardware components while maintaining flexibility and scalability. Whether used for secure door entry, equipment access, or IoT-based authentication, EmbeddedRFID-Gatekeeper offers a lightweight yet powerful solution for embedded security applications.
